### What I am pleased with
- Simple and easy to follow programming following SOLID principles by separating out all dependancies to the best of my ability.
- Using TDD to drive the development to see what was needed as the next step.

### What I would do with it if I had more time
- I would have looked into including a bigger frame of prime numbers that can be displayed. As of now the application can only return around 10000 prime numbers which could be increased if i split the arrays into smaller partitions.
- The display of the results could be better, joining all elements in a row imposes limitations as to how many can be displayed.
- I would have implemented a page view so in whole UX would be more inviting.
- Overall I feel it is a decent attempt as I have had limited exposure to Node but my working approach of researching before developing helped me overcome the gap in knowledge there.
